This will allow you to have a fabulous website from Tooplate's template after downloading  and copying the zip file to the correct location on the web server; you will need to use Wget to download the zip file locally to your machine or on the cloud. Choose a location like /tmp, and after the download, unzip the file and copy all under the unzip directory to the appropriate location, and you will be happy ðŸ˜Š!!!
